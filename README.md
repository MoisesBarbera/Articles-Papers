## MASTER_THESIS and MASTER_POSTER

Topic:  Calorimeter response to particles relevant for Dark Photon studies at the FASER experiment

The FASER experiment is a new-one oof a kind experiment under development at CERN by a selective group of researchers aiming to find dark matter indicators. If successful, this experiment will reinforce the existance of Dark Matter and bring the scientific community closer to knowing what it actually is.

My role consisted in using C++, ROOT and Geant4 to analyse the calorimeter response of this future detector and identify the expected behaviours of particles relevant for the identification of Dark Photons (a Dark Matter Indicator).

These files contain the write-up of my master's thesis as well as the poster presentation on the same topic.

## Report_Moises_Barbera_Nuclear

A statistical study developed on Python about the Eu152 isotope.

Abstract: In this study two ranges from an Eu152 isotope dataset have been investigated aiming to find the Minimum Detectable Activity of the sample by a spectrometer. A study of 3 peaks in the 4200 to 8000 channels range and a study of a single peak in the 1 to 800 channels range and above 77 keV. This report shows the individual analysis of each peak identifying the peak count and background to finally find their respective MDAs, which in average equals 13.37 B

## X_ray_diffraction

Topic: the benefits on crystallography for the analysis of the structure of Nano-powdered crystals and structure modelling simulations

A write up featuring data modeling and analysis in MATLAB and MS Excel after the extrction of data from utilising X-ray machines on hand-prepared nano-powdered crystals

Abstract: X-ray diffraction applied on crystals is of great interest in the context of crystallography, being able to provide answers about the molecular structure of crystals or the identification of unknown Nanopowdered crystal substances. A 35 kV and 1 mA emission current X-ray machine analysing the lattice constant through two filters, a 2mm aperture and a Ni foil one, of an unknow sample resulted to be between (7.11 ± 0.06)Ȧm (1% error) and (7.16 ± 0.1)Ȧm (1% error), consistent with the FCC crystal KI at (7.05 ± 0.01) Ȧm (1% error) with a mean crystallize size of the powder at around (86.9 ± 0.9)Ȧm (1% error). An extensive modelling simulation of the diffraction will confirm the identification of the sample as well as providing the information about the conditions required for crystals to be BCC or FCC and why CsCl, NaCl and Kcl are classified as Simple Cubic structures.


## Living_in_a_fined_tuned_universe

A study on the physical conditions happening all over the universe that converge for the successful existance of the universe itself and the existance of life in it.

Abstract:This document presents a series of examples, discoveries and phenomena that reveal how the Universe is “fine-tuned” for the existence of life. 6 different physical constants where identified to be key, including the cosmological constant, λ, strength of binding of atomic nuclei, ε, number of spatial dimensions, D, ratio of current and critical density in the Universe, Ω, the ratio of electrostatic and gravitational force, N, and the size of the entropy irregularity, Q.


## Solar neutrino measurements at SNO_FINAL

Abstract: This report presents the relevance of the solar neutrino problem and how the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) experiment worked and took measurements to provide evidence of the discrepancy in observed and expected solar neutrinos. SNO demonstrated that solar neutrinos from 8B decay into other flavour neutrinos on their way to Earth solving the problem.
